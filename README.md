<h1>Modular JS<h1>
<h3>CommonJS Modules, Clean Code, and Create a Has-Many app<h3>

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Chareesa/ModularJS-MyHasManyApp.svg?branch=nextBranch)](https://travis-ci.org/Chareesa/ModularJS-MyHasManyApp)

This project demonstrates how to use modules and includes a has-many relationship.
It is a small express app that has two related resources.. actors and movies.
Actors can be in many movies and a movie can have many actors.
This app prints out that relationship.

Clean, modular code was used as well as the separation of concerns principle. Each resource is in a separate file.
